# 🦆 DuckOS: The Quacking

**The incremental game where rubber ducks become sentient debugging deities and you accidentally become the universe's sysadmin**

---

## 🚀 What Even Is This?

Ever wondered what would happen if your rubber duck debugging sessions got _slightly_ out of hand? Well, wonder no more!

**DuckOS: The Quacking** is an incremental/idle game where you start as a burnt-out programmer with a single rubber duck, manually debugging code by clicking. Through escalating absurdity, you discover that ducks are actually sentient debugging entities that have been secretly maintaining the universe's code all along.

**Spoiler alert**: You end up managing the cosmic debugging infrastructure that keeps reality stable. Because of course you do.

## 🎮 The Journey

### 🏠 Phase 1: The Basement Programmer (0-100 bugs)

- _"Why won't this loop work?"_
- \*Duck: \*squeak\*\*
- _"Wait... did it just answer?"_

Start with manual clicking, discover your duck actually helps, question your sanity.

### 🏢 Phase 2: The Consultant (100-10K bugs)

- Running underground debugging consultancy
- Duck specializations (Bath Duck for CSS, Pirate Duck for security)
- Corporate contracts: _"Your password is 'password123', ye scurvy developer"_

### 🌐 Phase 3: The Duck Whisperer (10K-1M bugs)

- DuckOS v1.0 Released: Operating System runs on pure quack-based logic
- Microsoft offers $10 billion acquisition
- Duck Council votes: _unanimous squeaking_ = "We're not for sale, Bill"

### 🌌 Phase 4: The Reality Debugger (1M+ bugs)

- _CRITICAL: Universe.exe has encountered an error_
- Debugging the Big Bang itself
- _"Let there be light... and better variable names"_

## 🦆 Meet Your Debug Squad

| Duck Type                | Specialty            | Power Level                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🦆 **Basic Rubber Duck** | General debugging    | "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"   |
| 🛁 **Bath Duck**         | Frontend specialist  | "Did you try adding !important to everything?"  |
| 🏴‍☠️ **Pirate Duck**       | Security expert      | "Arrr-squeak!" (finds critical vulnerabilities) |
| 🎩 **Fancy Duck**        | Enterprise debugging | Bow tie makes bugs surrender                    |
| ⚡ **Quantum Duck**      | Paradox handling     | Exists in multiple debugging states             |
| 🌟 **Cosmic Duck**       | Universe maintenance | Transcends dimensional boundaries               |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Because even duck-powered debugging needs proper infrastructure:

- **React 18 + TypeScript** - For that sweet, sweet type safety (in a bug-fixing game, the irony is _chef's kiss_)
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management (no Redux boilerplate here, folks)
- **Tailwind CSS** - For rapid prototyping of our terminal/IDE aesthetic
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast builds (faster than a duck's quack)
- **Local Storage** - No backend needed, your ducks live in your browser

## 🎨 The Aesthetic

**Terminal/IDE vibes with escalating absurdity:**

- 🖥️ **Monospace fonts** - Because we're serious about that coding feel
- 🌑 **Dark theme** - Your eyes will thank you during those 3 AM debugging sessions
- 💚 **Green terminal text** - Classic hacker aesthetic
- 🟡 **Yellow highlights** - For those satisfying number increases
- 🧡 **Orange duck references** - Because ducks deserve their own color

## 🎵 Sample Debug Log

```
> Session #47,291
> Debugging NASA's Mars rover code
> Space Duck (experimental): *cosmic squeak*
> Translation: "The problem isn't the code, it's Mars itself"
> Fixed: Planetary alignment issue
> NASA scientists confused but grateful
>
> WARNING: Duck AI becoming self-aware
> Lead Duck: *philosophical squeak*
> Translation: "I debug, therefore I am"
> You: "Should I be worried?"
> Duck: *reassuring squeak*
> Translation: "Not yet, human. Not yet."

_P.S. - If you start hearing your rubber duck actually talk back, that's totally normal. Probably._
