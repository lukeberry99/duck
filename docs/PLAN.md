# Rubber Duck Debugging: Game Design Document

## Game Overview

**Title**: "DuckOS: The Quacking"  
**Genre**: Incremental/Idle Game  
**Platform**: Web Browser (Desktop/Mobile)  
**Target Audience**: Programmers, incremental game enthusiasts  
**Core Theme**: Absurdist humor around rubber duck debugging escalating to cosmic proportions

## Core Concept

Players start as a burnt-out programmer with a single rubber duck, manually debugging code by clicking. Through escalating absurdity, they discover ducks are sentient debugging entities that have been secretly maintaining the universe's code. The game progresses from fixing simple bugs to managing the cosmic debugging infrastructure that keeps reality stable.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Loop

1. **Debug Phase**: Click "Debug" to find and fix bugs
2. **Earn Resources**: Gain Code Quality points for each bug fixed
3. **Purchase Upgrades**: Spend Code Quality on ducks, tools, and improvements
4. **Automation**: Unlock auto-debugging to reduce manual clicking
5. **Prestige**: "Refactor" to reset progress but gain permanent bonuses

### Primary Resources

- **Bugs Fixed**: Total lifetime bugs resolved (main progress metric)
- **Code Quality**: Spendable currency earned from debugging
- **Debug Rate**: Bugs fixed per second (through automation)
- **Architecture Points**: Prestige currency gained from refactoring

### Progression Phases

- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design, touch-friendly interface
- **Discovery**: Leverage programming community, social media

## User Interface Design

### Layout Overview

The UI follows the classic incremental game pattern - **minimal, text-heavy, and functional**. Think Universal Paperclips meets a terminal IDE.

**Main Screen Layout** (single page, no navigation):

**Sound Design** (optional but recommended):

- Soft duck squeaks for successful debugging
- Keyboard typing sounds for manual debugging
- Success "ding" for upgrades
- Increasingly dramatic squeaks for higher-tier ducks
- Cosmic whooshes for reality-level debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Core Concept**: Build minimal prototype in 2-3 days
2. **Gather Feedback**: Share with programmer friends and incremental game fans
3. **Refine Design**: Iterate based on initial feedback
4. **Full Development**: Execute 8-week implementation plan
5. **Soft Launch**: Release to small community for testing
6. **Marketing Push**: Leverage programming communities and incremental game forums
