# Phase 1 - Core Mechanics

**Phase**: Foundation (Week 1-2)  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  

## Description
Implement the fundamental game mechanics that make the game playable.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement manual debug clicking functionality
- [ ] Create resource generation system (bugs → code quality)
- [ ] Add basic upgrade purchasing logic
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality with localStorage
- [ ] Create first duck upgrade (Basic Rubber Duck)
- [ ] Add upgrade cost calculations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking debug button increases bugs fixed counter
- [ ] Code quality is earned for each bug fixed
- [ ] Players can purchase their first duck upgrade
- [ ] Upgrades have proper cost scaling
- [ ] Game state saves automatically and loads on refresh
- [ ] All mechanics work without errors

## Dependencies
- PHASE1-02-core-game-state
- PHASE1-03-basic-ui-components

## Implementation Notes
- Start with simple 1:1 bug to code quality ratio
- First upgrade should cost 100 code quality
- Implement basic cost scaling (e.g., cost * 1.5 per purchase)
- Auto-save every 10 seconds or on state change

## Success Criteria from PLAN.md
- Can click to debug and earn Code Quality ✓
- Can purchase first duck upgrade ✓
- Game state persists between sessions ✓
