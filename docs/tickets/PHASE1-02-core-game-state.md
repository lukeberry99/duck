# Phase 1 - Core Game State

**Phase**: Foundation (Week 1-2)  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  

## Description
Implement the core game state management using Zustand with proper TypeScript interfaces.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create GameState interface with all required properties
- [ ] Implement Duck and Upgrade type definitions
- [ ] Create gameStore.ts with Zustand store
- [ ] Add basic state actions (increment bugs, spend code quality)
- [ ] Implement state persistence to localStorage
- [ ] Create utility functions for state calculations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GameState interface matches specification from PLAN.md
- [ ] All state mutations work correctly
- [ ] State persists between browser sessions
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Basic state actions are testable

## Dependencies
- PHASE1-01-project-setup

## Code Structure
```typescript
interface GameState {
  bugsFixed: number;
  codeQuality: number;
  debugRate: number;
  ducks: Duck[];
  upgrades: Upgrade[];
  lastUpdate: number;
}
```

## Notes
- Use Zustand's persist middleware for localStorage
- Implement proper TypeScript strict typing
- Consider offline progress calculation from lastUpdate timestamp
