# Phase 4 - Performance Optimization

**Phase**: Launch Preparation (Week 7-8)  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours  

## Description
Optimize the game's performance for production deployment and ensure smooth experience across all devices.

## Tasks
- [ ] Optimize bundle size through code splitting and tree shaking
- [ ] Profile and improve runtime performance
- [ ] Implement memory leak prevention measures
- [ ] Add loading state management for better UX
- [ ] Optimize game loop performance
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial bundle size < 500KB gzipped
- [ ] Game maintains 60fps on mid-range devices
- [ ] Memory usage stays stable during long sessions
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Game loop runs efficiently without lag
- [ ] Performance monitoring is in place

## Dependencies
- PHASE3-04-ui-ux-polish
- All previous phases should be complete

## Optimization Techniques
- **Bundle Splitting**: Lazy load non-critical components
- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code from dependencies
- **Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary React re-renders
- **Game Loop**: Optimize tick calculations
- **Memory Management**: Clean up intervals and listeners

## Performance Targets
- **Load Time**: < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Frame Rate**: 60fps on mid-range devices
- **Memory**: < 50MB after 1 hour of play
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB gzipped
