# Phase 3 - Advanced Features

**Phase**: Depth & Polish (Week 5-6)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours  

## Description
Add complex mechanics that provide depth and strategic choices for engaged players.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement duck specializations for different code types
- [ ] Create batch debugging operations for large codebases
- [ ] Add debug session management system
- [ ] Implement performance optimization challenges
- [ ] Create late-game mechanics (Quantum, Cosmic ducks)
- [ ] Add advanced automation options

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Duck specializations provide meaningful strategic choices
- [ ] Batch operations feel satisfying and impactful
- [ ] Session management adds organizational depth
- [ ] Performance challenges create engaging puzzles
- [ ] Late-game mechanics maintain player interest
- [ ] Advanced features don't overwhelm new players

## Dependencies
- PHASE3-01-prestige-system
- PHASE2-02-upgrade-system

## Advanced Features to Implement
- **Code Type Specialization**: Web, Mobile, Backend, AI/ML
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple bugs simultaneously
- **Session Management**: Organize debugging work efficiently
- **Performance Challenges**: Timed debugging scenarios
- **Reality Debugging**: Universe-level bug fixing

## Specialization System
- Different code types have different bug patterns
- Specialized ducks get efficiency bonuses
- Mix-and-match strategies for optimal debugging
- Unlocked through progression milestones

## Notes
- Features should enhance, not complicate core gameplay
- Provide clear explanations for complex mechanics
- Maintain game balance across all features
